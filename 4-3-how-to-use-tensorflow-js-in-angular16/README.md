## Setting Up OpenAI in VSCode

[OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/) provides APIs that developers can use to integrate AI models, like ChatGPT, into applications. Setting up OpenAI with Visual Studio Code (VSCode) involves preparing your development environment for Node.js and then integrating OpenAI's SDK. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Install Visual Studio Code:

If you haven't already, download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

### 2. Install Node.js and npm:

To interact with OpenAI's API using JavaScript/TypeScript, you'll need Node.js and npm:

* Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the LTS version.
* After installation, verify by running these commands in your terminal or command prompt:

| bash ``node -v`` npm-v |
| ---------------------- |

### 3. Create a New Node.js Project:

Initialize a new Node.js project:

| bash ``mkdir my-openai-project``cd my-openai-project``npminit -y |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- |

### 4. Install the OpenAI Node.js SDK:

Within your project directory, install the OpenAI SDK:

| bash``npminstall openai |
| ----------------------- |

### 5. Extensions for VSCode:

Some useful extensions for this development include:

* Prettier - Code formatter: Helps format your JavaScript/TypeScript code.

  ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/973ld-FtRTuMtY2gn9sqoW0VTtwRmKShUYOer9muGRy2rd7kzDqrI77n8CQyGj7WKIs6rvdQBq2MOCdCX7JEF9r8L4KIKzB-ZsaRasZKecNrug4yMlWsOdydSz_qoajlYROBk4z8ZR6a9BacfD590oI)

* Search for the extension and click the `Install` button.

### 6. Start Coding with OpenAI SDK:

Create a new `.js` file in your project, such as `index.js`. Open this file in VSCode and start integrating the OpenAI SDK. For security reasons, store your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:

| plaintext``OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE |
| ------------------------------------------- |

And then in `index.js`:

| javascript ``require('dotenv').config();``const { OpenAIApi } =require('openai');``const openai =newOpenAIApi({``key: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY ``});``async function queryGPT3(promptText) {``const response =awaitopenai.complete({``model:"text-davinci-002",``prompt: promptText,``maxTokens:150 ``});`` returnresponse.data.choices[0].text.trim();``}``//Test the function``queryGPT3("Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello World'").then(console.log); |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### 7. Running Your Code:

You can run your code using Node.js:

| bash``node index.js |
| ------------------- |

Now you've successfully set up OpenAI for development in VSCode. Remember to keep your API key secure and avoid hardcoding it directly into your scripts. Using environment variables, as shown above, is a safer practice.
